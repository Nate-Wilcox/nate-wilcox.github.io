<h1>Portfolio Website</h1>

<h2>Welcome to my portfolio website</h2>
<h3>My name is Nathaniel Wilcox, but I prefer to go by Nate.</h3>

<h4>This was a passion project that really let me dive into web development in a way that my collegiatye education never delved into.</h4>

<p> This is my first attempt at a portfolio webpage usign HTML5, CSS, Javascript, and Github pages.</p>

<p> I decided to do it this way instead of going through a webhosting service that gives you templates to plug and play for the experience and the indivuality that I can atain by having a webpage made from scratch that I can continiously update and deploy.</p>
